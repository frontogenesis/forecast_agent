# Weather Forecast for Houston, Texas

**Hazardous Weather Alert:** Potential for heavy rain and high heat index values

The upcoming weather forecast for Houston indicates a notable increase in humidity and temperatures over the next few days, with peak temperatures expected to reach into the upper 80s and low 90s with corresponding high heat index values approaching 100Â°F. Significant precipitation is likely, particularly on the afternoon of June 24, with a precipitation probability of 60% to 72% throughout the day. This could lead to accumulation of heavy rainfall during the afternoon and evening hours.

Wind conditions are generally favorable, with sustained winds around 10-11 knots, which is just above 20 mph at times, particularly in the afternoon hours. Although these winds can help mitigate heat stress, they may not provide enough relief during peak temperature times, making outdoor activities potentially hazardous if proper precautions are not taken. Residents should remain vigilant regarding weather conditions, especially on June 24, when heavy rain could lead to localized flooding.
